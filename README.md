# NN_Charge_Classifier-master
This is a neural net I build that classifies molecules according to their charge. They are classified to have 0, 1, -1, -2, or -3 charges. Training and Testing data is provided (Validation data is automatically pulled by the model), and is organized in either 1000 SMILE strings or 1,000,000 SMILE strings. Charges are also given, with 0 representing a charge of 0, 1 representing 1, 2 representing -1, 3 representing -2, and 4 representing -3.
